# PlottingOurBlocks

<p>Try to duplicate the image below by adjusting the CSS code provided. Use <b><i>margins</b></i> and <b><i>paddings</b></i> to adjust the spaces between divisions and use the <b><i>display</b></i> property to be able to put each block in its proper place. We may need additional CSS properties.</p>

While we do this assignment, we can make use <b>height</b> as well as the <b>vertical-align</b> property to give the necessary height to the division and also to vertically align some of the inline-blocks.
